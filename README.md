# BPG-SH
This repository contains a Python-based pipeline for assembling the pangenome of microbial species from FASTA formatted genomic sequences. The pipeline integrates various bioinformatics tools to annotate genomes, extract protein-coding sequences, and analyze protein clusters to distinguish between core, accessory, and unique proteins across multiple genomes.
